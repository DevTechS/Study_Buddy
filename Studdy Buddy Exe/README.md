Study Buddy Usage:
To open the application, please run "StudyBuddy.exe"
The most basic way to interact with Buddy is to pet him with your mouse cursor. If you pet him enough he will get ready to do a trick. If you put your mouse up high, he will do a jump
Clicking the clock in front of Buddy will open up a window that will allow you to set a timer for any length of time less than 10 hours.
